        Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948)
        was a barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan.[2] Jinnah served as the leader
        of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on 14 August 1947,
        and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is revered in Pakistan
        as Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum, ("Father of the Nation"). His
        birthday is a national holiday in Pakistan.Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah
        was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to British
        India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national
        politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in
        the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these
        early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to
        shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in
        which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All India
        Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to
        safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the
        Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as 
        political anarchy.By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that Muslims of the Indian
        subcontinent should have their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by
        Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation. During the Second
        World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned,
        and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for
        Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing
        formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree
        to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of
        Pakistan.
        Jinnah's given name at birth was Mahomedali Jinnahbhai,and he likely was born in 1876
        , to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented apartment on the second floor
        of Wazir Mansion near Karachi,[3] now in Sindh, Pakistan but then within the Bombay
        Presidency of British India. Jinnah's family was from a Gujarati Khoja Shi’a Muslim
        background, though Jinnah later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings. After his death,
        his relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had converted in later life to the
        Sunni sect. His religion at the time of his death was disputed in multiple court cases.
        Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background, his father was a merchant and was born to
        a family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state of Gondal
        (Kathiawar, Gujarat); his mother was also of that village. They had moved to Karachi in
        1875, having married before their departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic 
        boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to
        Europe for shipping than Bombay.Jinnah was the second child; he had three brothers
        and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah. The parents were
        native Gujarati speakers, and the children also came to speak Kutchi and English.
        Jinnah was not fluent in Gujarati, his mother-tongue, nor in Urdu; he was more fluent
        in English. Except for Fatima, little is known of his siblings, where they settled or
        if they met with their brother as he advanced in his legal and political careers.As
        a boy, Jinnah lived for a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have attended the
        Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John
        Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian
        Missionary Society High School.He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at
        the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of
        stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his
        spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his
        books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer
        ,Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained
        a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust,
        urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.
        As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, he remains Pakistan's greatest leader.
